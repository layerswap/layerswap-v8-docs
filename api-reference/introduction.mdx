## Welcome

V8 Bridge Deployment API allows automated deployment of a **trustless** V8 bridge to your rollup. The deployment is fully automatic and takes under 15 minutes, making the network instantly visible and accessible at https://layerswap.io/v8.

### Deployment Actions

1. Configures network attributes, logos, names, RPC, and explorer URLs
2. Initializes a Solver with initial liquidity from the canonical bridge
3. Deploys [V8 contracts](https://github.com/layerswap/layerswap-atomic-bridge/tree/main/chains/evm) on the target network
4. Creates and enables routes supporting the same asset

Once completed, your network is automatically added to the [V8 interface](https://layerswap.io/v8), enabling users to bridge assets trustlessly between chains using the enhanced V8 atomic swaps.
