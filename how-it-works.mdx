## V8 bridging protocol
Layerswap V8 is the first [trustless asset bridging protocol](https://layerswap.notion.site) that enables any network to join permissionlessly. It leverages an advanced version of Atomic Swaps for a completely trustless asset exchange between two parties: the user and the solver..

## Bridge Deployment API
This API deploys a trustless bridge to your rollup. The automated system requires no manual intervention, completing the entire bridge deployment process in under 15 minutes. Once deployed, your network is instantly accessible for cross-chain bridging at https://layerswap.io/v8.
