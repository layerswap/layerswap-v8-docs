## V8 bridging protocol
Layerswap V8 is the first trustless asset bridging protocol that enables any network to join permissionlessly. It leverates advanced version of Atomic Swaps for complete trustless asset exchange beetwin 2 parties (user and solver).

### Bridge Deployment API
Easily deploy a trustless bridge to your rollup with Layerswapâ€™s V8 Bridge Deployment API. This permissionless, automated system requires no manual intervention, completing the entire bridge deployment process in under 15 minutes. Once deployed, your network is instantly accessible for cross-chain bridging at https://layerswap.io/v8.

### How it Works?
The V8 bridge deployment system follows a series of automated steps to establish a secure, trustless bridge between networks. Deployed on the Layerswap V8 Protocol, the bridge leverages advanced Atomic Swaps for seamless and secure cross-chain transactions. Learn more about the protocol here: https://layerswap.notion.site

Deployment Steps:

1) Validate Network Parameters (e.g., chain IDs, RPCs)
2) Deploy V8 Contracts on your network
3) Bootstrap Solver with initial liquidity from the canonical bridge
4) Configure Routes for all existing networks and supported assets
5) Add Your Network to the V8 interface at https://layerswap.io/v8

<Note>
  Security Note: The V8 Protocol ensures trustless asset exchange via atomic swaps, eliminating counterparty risk and third-party reliance.
