<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a commitment">
    Call the `commit()` function to lock funds for a specified party with a timelock of [$T + \beta$](/protocol-spec/model/#standard-flow).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor the destination chain">
    - Watch for the `TokenLocked` event or use the `Id` on the destination chain by calling `getDetails()`.
    - Verify that the `hashlock` of the `HTLC` on the destination chain provides sufficient time to act, ensuring it is at least [$T + 2\Delta$](/protocol-spec/model/#standard-flow).
    - Once detected, capture the `hashlock` value.
    <Note>
      The state of the destination chain should be read from a Light Client if one exists; if not, it should be read from multiple RPC providers.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add lock to your PreHTLC on the source chain">
    Call `addLock()`, passing in the captured `hashlock` and `timelock` of [$T + \Delta$](/protocol-spec/model/#standard-flow).
  </Step>
  <Step title="(signature flow) Sign a message instead of adding a lock" stepNumber="3*">
    The user signs a message containing the `Id`, `hashlock`, and `timelock`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
[Edge Case: Party 2 fails to act on commitment](/protocol-spec/edge-cases)

- Wait for the `timelock` to expire.
- Call `refund()` on the source chain to reclaim your funds.
</Warning>

<Warning>
[Edge Case: Party 2 fails to release at all](/protocol-spec/edge-cases)

- Wait for the `timelock` to expire.
- Call `refund()` on the source chain to reclaim your funds.
</Warning>

<Warning>
[Edge Case: Party 2 fails to release Party 1â€™s funds](/protocol-spec/edge-cases)

- If funds are not released on the destination chain, watch the source chain for the `TokenRedeemed` event (or `getDetails()` function).
- Once detected, capture the `secret` and call `redeem()` on the destination chain.
</Warning>
