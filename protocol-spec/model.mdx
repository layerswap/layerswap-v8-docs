The protocol model relies on atomic swaps for parties exchanging assets across different chains. The model outlines the core flow of assets and actions that should be taken by each party for a successful asset exchange. Depending on the source and destination, and whether there is a party willing to exchange on those chains, either the [Standard flow](#standard-flow) or [Multi-hop flow](#multi-hop-flow) is used.

### Standard flow

When there is a party that directly supports both the source and destination chains and is willing to perform the swap, the standard flow applies. The user calls `commit` by setting the timelock to $T+\Delta$. The party willing to perform the exchange must call the `lock` function on the destination chain, setting the timelock to $T+2\Delta$.

Here are the steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Commit">
    The user creates a commit object on the source chain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Party Lock">
    The party creates a lock object on the destination chain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="User AddLock">
    The user adds a lock to the commitment on the source chain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Party Redeem">
    The party redeems the locked funds on the destination chain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="User Redeem">
    The user redeems the locked funds on the source chain.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Multi-hop flow

When transferring funds from a source chain to a destination chain isn't possible due to a lack of any party directly linking the two, the swap is completed using a multi-hop approach (with chain length $n$). In this setup, the user initially commits funds on the source chain to the first party. Each party calls `commit` so committing funds for the next party in the sequence, with the final party on the destination chain calls `lock` , locking the funds with a `hashlock` and the longest `timelock`, set to $T + 2^{n-1}\Delta$ .

Subsequently, each party from the second-to-last in the chain back to the source performs the `addLock` function with the same `hashlock` as used on the destination chain, but with progressively shorter `timelock`s—starting from $T + 2^{0}\Delta$ for the second-to-last party. This process continues recursively, with each party adding a lock using the `hashlock` and `timelock` specific to its position in the chain.

Finally, the user on the source chain calls `addLock` with the `hashlock` and `timelock` $T+2^{n-2}\Delta$. At this point, all parties have locked funds with both a `hashlock` and `timelock`.

When the party on the destination chain calls `redeem`  , revealing the secret, he transfers the user’s funds and redeems the locked funds for himself. This secret revelation allows each preceding party, one by one, to `redeem` their funds back through the chain, completing the multi-hop swap.
