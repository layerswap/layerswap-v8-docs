To overcome challenges with the original HTLC, we introduce PreHTLC, an enhanced version of HTLC. PreHTLC represents the **user's intent and commitment to exchange with the LP** but without the initial requirement of a Hashlock. In this model:

- **Secret Management Delegated**: The LP generates and manages the secret, relieving the user of this responsibility.
- **Claim Transactions Simplified**: The LP executes the claim transaction on the destination chain, addressing the issue of users lacking assets on a new network.

*Here's how it works*

Delegating secret management to the LP does not create trust assumptions. When the LP reveals the Secret to claim funds in the source network, the Secret becomes public, allowing anyone to use it to unlock the userâ€™s funds in the destination network. The protocol incentivizes the release of user funds by reserving a portion of the total bridging fee as a reward for this task.
