The auction systems are centralized; they do not introduce any trust assumptions or affect the security mechanisms of the core protocol. The auction is solely responsible for matching the user and the Solver.

The auction system works like this:

1. Get the list of active LPs from the [Discovery](/protocol/discovery) contract.
2. Accept quotes from the LPs.
3. Decide the winner.
4. Notify the dApp. The dApp then executes the [Atomic Swap](/protocol/atomic-swaps-prehtlc).

More technical details can be found in the [Auction Spec](/protocol-spec/auction).
