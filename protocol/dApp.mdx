### Overview

The [Layerswap V8 Bridge dApp](https://layerswap.io/v8) serves as the central interface for seamless cross-chain transactions. It integrates with the Discovery mechanism to fetch available Solvers and participates in the Solver auction process to determine optimal routes for bridging.

The dApp has **three** main responsibilities:

- Connect to the [Discovery registry](/protocol/discovery) and fetch available Solvers/networks.
- Connect to the [Auction](/protocol/auction) to transmit the user's intent and get quotes from Solvers.
- Execute an [Atomic Swap](/protocol/atomic-swaps-prehtlc) flow.

### Observing the destination lock

The dApp must observe the destination lock created by the Solver and provide the `hashlock` to the user to complete the atomic swap process. Observing this transaction can be done in the following ways, in order of priority:
1. Bootstrap a Light Client (e.g., [Helios](https://github.com/a16z/helios)) for the destination chain and read the lock state from it.
2. If there is no Light Client available, read and verify the lock state from multiple RPC providers.
