The [Layerswap V8 Bridge dApp](https://layerswap.io/v8) serves as the central interface for seamless cross-chain transactions. It integrates with the LP Discovery mechanism to fetch available liquidity providers (LPs) and participates in the LP auction process to determine optimal routes for bridging.

The dApp has **three** main responsibilities:

1. Connect to the [Discovery registry](/protocol/discovery) and fetch available LPs/networks.
2. Connect to the [Auction](/protocol/auction) to transmit the user's intent and get quotes from LPs.
3. Execute an atomic swap flow by locking assets and observing transactions on the destination chain through RPC or Light Client (e.g., [Helios](https://github.com/a16z/helios)).
