The Layerswap V8 protocol is a peer-to-peer system for bridging/swapping crypto assets from one blockchain network to another. The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts, deployed to all [supported networks](/protocol/contracts).

- V8 is built on top of an [improved version of Atomic Swaps](/protocol/atomic-swaps-prehtlc), which allows two parties to exchange assets trustlessly across different chains. Specifically, the two parties are the **user** and the **solver**. Users send their **intents** to solvers, who fulfill them using Atomic Swaps.
- There are **no third parties or gatekeepers**; the security of the exchange is fully ensured by the cryptographic protocol and [Light Client](/protocol/dApp) running on the user's browser.
- On-chain [Discovery](/protocol/discovery) registry, where new solvers and networks can [permissionlessly](/protocol/usage-add-new-network) register.
