The Layerswap V8 protocol is a peer-to-peer system for bridging/swapping crypto assets from one blockchain network to another. The protocol is implemented as a set of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts, deployed to all [supported networks](/protocol/contracts).

- V8 is built on top of an [improved version of Atomic Swaps](/protocol/atomic-swaps-prehtlc), which allows two parties to exchange assets trustlessly across different chains. Specifically, the two parties are the **user** and the **liquidity provider**. Users send requests to liquidity providers, who fulfill them using Atomic Swaps. There are **no third parties or gatekeepers**; the security of the exchange is fully ensured by the cryptographic protocol.
- Permissionless on-chain [Discovery](/protocol/discovery) registry, where new LPs and new networks can register.
- [Permissionless addition](/protocol/usage-add-new-network) of new networks/assets and liquidity providers.
