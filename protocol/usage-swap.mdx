<Steps>
  <Step title="Discovery">
    Read the on-chain [Discovery](/protocol/discovery) contract to retrieve protocol metadata: active LPs, networks, and routes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auction / LP Selection">
    Send an order to the [Auction](/protocol/auction) to find the best LP/price for the given source and destination.
  </Step>
  <Step title="User and LP Atomic Swap">
    Perform an atomic swap using [PreHTLCs](protocol/atomic-swaps-prehtlc).
  </Step>
</Steps>

The V8 Protocol makes bridging **completely transparent and fully controllable** by the client. The integrator has complete control over every aspect, from selecting and ranking LPs independently to performing final verification, ensuring the entire process is **trustless, transparent, and under their control**.
