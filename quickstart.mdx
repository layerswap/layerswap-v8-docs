## V8 bridging protocol
Layerswap V8 is the first [trustless asset bridging protocol](https://layerswap.notion.site) that enables any network to join permissionlessly. It leverages an advanced version of Atomic Swaps for a completely trustless asset exchange between two parties: the user and the solver.

## Bridge Deployment API
This API deploys a trustless bridge to your rollup. The automated system requires no manual intervention, completing the entire bridge deployment process in under 10 minutes. Once deployed, your network is instantly accessible for cross-chain bridging on [Bridge UI](https://layerswap.io/v8).

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to learn how to autonomously deploy a trustless bridge on any rollup.

### 1) Get API Keys
The Layerswap V8 Bridge Deployment API is currently in early-access. To request your API keys, please fill out [this form](https://ix9g7fdi92w.typeform.com/to/EFRPexAw).

### 2) Call the Deploy Bridge Endpoint
Hereâ€™s an example for deploying a bridge on the OP Stack rollup:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://atomic-dev.layerswap.cloud/api/v0.2/deployment \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'X-V8-APIKEY: <api-key>' \
  --data '{
  "chain_id": 45646545646,
  "network_name": "YourNetwork_TESTNET",
  "network_display_name": "Your Network Testnet",
  "logo_url": "<url to logo>",
  "network_group": "EVM_OPTIMISM_EIP1559",
  "is_testnet": true,
  "canonical_bridge_address": "0x1200000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "gas_price_oracle": "0x420000000000000000000000000000000000000F",
  "native_asset_symbol": "ETH",
  "native_asset_decimals": 18,
  "public_rpc": "https://ethereum.publicnode.com",
  "private_rpc": "https://ethereum.publicnode.com",
  "address_lookup_explorer_template": "https://etherscan.io/address/{0}",
  "tx_lookup_explorer_template": "https://etherscan.io/tx/{0}"
}'
```

For more endpoints and a detailed explanation of each, check the [API Reference](/api-reference).

### 3) Check Deployment Status
To monitor the deployment process, periodically call the Deployment Status endpoint:

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://atomic-dev.layerswap.cloud/api/v0.2/deployment/{deploymentId} \
  --header 'X-V8-APIKEY: <api-key>'
```

Continue polling until the response status is `Completed`.

### 4) Access Your Network for Bridging
Once the deployment is complete, your bridge will be available for access. Visit [Layerswap V8](https://layerswap.io/v8) to start bridging.
