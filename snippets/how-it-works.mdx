The V8 bridge deployment system follows a series of automated steps to establish a secure, trustless bridge between networks. Deployed on the Layerswap V8 Protocol, the bridge leverages advanced Atomic Swaps for seamless and secure cross-chain transactions. Learn more about the protocol [here](https://layerswap.notion.site).

#### Deployment Steps

- Validates Network Parameters (e.g., chain IDs, RPCs)
- Bootstraps Solver (LP) with initial liquidity from the canonical bridge
- Deploys [V8 Contracts](https://github.com/layerswap/layerswap-atomic-bridge) on your network
- Configures Routes for all existing networks and supported assets
- Adds Your Network to the [V8 interface](https://layerswap.io/v8).
