### How it Works?

The V8 bridge deployment system follows a series of automated steps to establish a secure, trustless bridge between networks. Deployed on the Layerswap V8 Protocol, the bridge leverages advanced Atomic Swaps for seamless and secure cross-chain transactions. Learn more about the protocol here: https://layerswap.notion.site

Deployment Steps:

- Validates Network Parameters (e.g., chain IDs, RPCs)
- Bootstraps Solver with initial liquidity from the canonical bridge
- Deploys V8 Contracts on your network
- Configures Routes for all existing networks and supported assets
- Adds Your Network to the V8 interface.
