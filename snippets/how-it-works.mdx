The V8 bridge deployment system follows a series of automated steps to establish a secure, trustless bridge between networks. Deployed on the [Layerswap V8 Protocol](protocol/introduction), the bridge leverages advanced Atomic Swaps for seamless and secure cross-chain transactions. Learn more about the protocol.

### Deployment Steps

- Validates network parameters (e.g., chain IDs, RPCs)
- Bootstraps the Solver with initial liquidity from the canonical bridge
- Deploys [V8 Contracts](https://github.com/layerswap/layerswap-atomic-bridge) on your network
- Configures routes for all existing networks and supported assets
- Adds your network to the [V8 Bridge UI](https://layerswap.io/v8)
